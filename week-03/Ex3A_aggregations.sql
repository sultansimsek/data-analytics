-- 1. Write a query to find the price of the cheapest item that Northwind sells. Then write a
-- second query to find the name of the product that has that price.
SELECT MIN(UnitPrice) 
FROM Products
-- 2.5
SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice
FROM Products
WHERE UnitPrice = 2.5
-- 2. Write a query to find the average price of all items that Northwind sells.
-- (Bonus: Once you have written a working query, try asking Claude or ChatGPT for help
-- using the ROUND function to round the average price to the nearest cent.)
SELECT ROUND( AVG(UnitPrice), 2)
FROM Products

-- 3. Write a query to find the price of the most expensive item that Northwind sells. Then
-- write a second query to find the name of the product with that price, plus the name of
-- the supplier for that product.
SELECT MAX(UnitPrice)
FROM Products
-- 263.5
SELECT UnitPrice, ProductName, CompanyName
FROM Products p JOIN Suppliers s ON p.SupplierID = s.SupplierID
WHERE UnitPrice = 263.5

-- 4. Write a query to find total monthly payroll (the sum of all the employees’ monthly salaries).
SELECT ROUND(SUM(Salary), 2) AS monthlypayroll 
FROM Employees

-- 5. Write a query to identify the highest salary and the lowest salary amounts which any
-- employee makes. (Just the amounts, not the specific employees!)
SELECT MIN(Salary) AS lowest, MAX(Salary) AS highest
FROM Employees

-- 6. Write a query to find the name and supplier ID of each supplier and the number of
-- items they supply. Hint: Join is your friend here.
SELECT COUNT(*) AS totalpro, Suppliers.SupplierID, Suppliers.CompanyName
FROM Products JOIN Suppliers ON Products.SupplierID = Suppliers.SupplierID
GROUP BY Suppliers.SupplierID, Suppliers.CompanyName
ORDER BY Suppliers.SupplierID, Suppliers.CompanyName;


-- 7. Write a query to find the list of all category names and the average price for items in each category.
SELECT CategoryName AS name_ , ROUND(AVG(UnitPrice), 2) AS avgprice
FROM Categories JOIN Products ON Categories.CategoryID = Products.CategoryID
GROUP BY CategoryName
ORDER BY CategoryName;

-- 8. Write a query to find, for all suppliers that provide at least 5 items to Northwind, what
-- is the name of each supplier and the number of items they supply.
SELECT CompanyName, COUNT(ProductID) as amount
FROM Products p JOIN Suppliers s ON p.SupplierID = s.SupplierID
GROUP BY CompanyName
HAVING amount >= 5
ORDER BY CompanyName

-- 9. Write a query to list products currently in inventory by the product id, product name,
-- and inventory value (calculated by multiplying unit price by the number of units on
-- hand). Sort the results in descending order by value. If two or more have the same
-- value, order by product name. If a product is not in stock, leave it off the list.
SELECT ProductID, ProductName, ROUND(UnitPrice*UnitsInStock, 2)  AS inventoryvalue
FROM Products
WHERE UnitsInStock > 0 
ORDER BY inventoryvalue DESC, ProductName ASC
