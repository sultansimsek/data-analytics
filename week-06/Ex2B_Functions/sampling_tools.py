# a) The team wants to feature a "Product of the Day" based on one randomly selected item. Use random.choice() to select one product and print the result with an appropriate label. Be sure to run the script a few times to confirm the selection changes with each run. 
#print(random.choice(products))

# b) Three products need to be selected for a brief usability survey. The same product should not appear more than once. Use random.sample() to select 3 items from products without replacement and print the results.
# print(random.sample(products, 3))

# c) For a presentation, all products should be displayed in a randomized order to avoid any appearance of ranking. Use random.shuffle() to shuffle the products list, then print the shuffled lis
random.shuffle(products)
print(products)

#d) Use random.randint() to generate a simulated daily transaction count between 50 and 300, and print the result with a label.
daily_transaction = random.randint(50, 300)
print(daily_transaction)
